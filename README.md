# Heart Failure Prediction
## Overview
A project to train a machine learning model which predicts heart failure using different detectable factors
People with cardiovascular disease need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from kaggle datsets<br>
Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data<br>
The dataset contains 12 attributes that can be used to predict mortality in heart diseases.<br>
